# Tintan - Titanium development with style!

<img src="https://github.com/vic/tintan/raw/master/pub/pachuco.png" title="¡Ya llegó su pachucote!" />

## What it is?

*Tintan is to Titanium applications what Apache Buildr is to java projects*

Tintan is a tiny tool for helping developers use their favourite javascript-language
(like CoffeeSript/ClojureScript) for writting Titanium mobile applications.
Tintan aims to integrate these languages compilation right into Titanium's compiler chain, and features a
set of ready-to-use @mde/jake taks suitable for building, testing, packaging and publishing your apps.


## Features

* Integrate javascript-targetting-languages into Titanium's compiler chain.

* Integrate BDD framework in your Titanium workflow.

* Provide a set of ready-to-use @mre/jake tasks suitable for Titanium projects.

* Provide a friendly command like interface to build, test and deploy your apps.


## Status

Tintan is currently in its early days, but I expect it to mature rapidly as I'm currently using it to
develop some apps. Tintan is the evolution of @vic/jakesmine with some inspiration from the cofee-script
titanium compiler plugin.
